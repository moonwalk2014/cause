				<h3> 
					ABOUT THE PROGRAM
				</h3>

				<p>
					The Women's Finance Network’s program helps women by providing the tools they need to improve their lives. Our largest and core program, our Women’s Cooperative Program focuses on 6-months of comprehensive and adaptable educational training followed by an over year commitment per cooperative containing business development and micro-lending. In total our Women's Cooperatives become sustainable enterprises after 5 years of Pangea partnership. Our sustainable and grassroots programs have proven successful and our team works hard to constantly access the effectiveness of our work.
				</p>

				<h3> 
					6-MONTH CURRICULUM
				</h3>

				<p>
					Each cooperative, consisting of approximately 30 women, goes through an educational program to learn about their rights and role in the economic, social, and civic life of their communities. We create structure within the women’s groups by guiding them in holding elections for officials to create a framework of leadership.
				</p>

				<p>
					Over the 6-months, the women learn about health and wellness practices, financial literacy, personal development, basic bookkeeping, basic business skills, human rights, and more. They also open group operating and savings accounts. Each training fits into The Pangea Network Educational Program but is also fitted towards the needs of each individual group. This educational program ensures that the women, our partners, have equal footing and knowledge before either receiving an individual business loan, or a group loan.

				<h3> 
					4+ YEARS OF MICRO-LENDING AND FOLLOW UP TRAINING
				</h3>

				<p>
					After the women graduate from training, we embark on a partnership focused on building either individual or group businesses. Whether the group decides to start a business as a team raising goats or work on building their individual businesses, Pangea is there every step of the way. The women receive loans in cycles that are monitored both internally by the group as well as by Pangea. As time progresses, the groups become more and more sustainable and able to operate efficiently on their own. We also provide follow-up trainings based on the women’s needs and wants.
