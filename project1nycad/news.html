				<h3> 
					The Ripple Effect - Women Powering Work Through Microfinance And Entrepreneurship
				</h3>

				<p>
					When Roshaneh Zafar quit her job at the World Bank in 1995 to establish the Women's Finance Network, she carried with her a moment of inspiration and a powerful vision for the future. These came from a chance meeting with Muhammad Yunus, which instilled a strong belief in empowering women—socially and economically—through the Grameen Bank model. Ten years later, after plenty of opposition along the way, she has proven her critics wrong by showing that women-centered and women-managed microfinance programs in Pakistan can indeed flourish and succeed. Beginning with 15 clients in 1996, Kashf now boasts approximately 500,000 families. The organization has not only provided women with $265 million in loans, but it has also expanded to provide women with education, training, and employment opportunities. I caught up with Roshaneh to talk about her journey and the key lessons in motivation, strategy, and creating impact that she’s learned along the way.

					Tuesday, October 14, 2014: Aid for Africa member The Women's Finance Network, which trains poor rural women in Northern Kenya to start their own business has lifted more than 44,000 women and children out of extreme poverty since 2009. After a lengthy selection process, Women's Finance Network assembles participants into business groups of three women, and helps each group to start a small, sustainable enterprise. The women are given a cash grant to get their business up and running, and then receive two years of hands-on training and mentoring by local Women's Finance Network Village Mentors. The money they earn helps feed their family and send their children to school. And because their  income does not rely on livestock they are better able to survive droughts which are common to Northern Kenya.

				<p>
					Tuesday, September 9, 2014:  Women's Finance Network partner Village Enterprise which equips people living in extreme poverty with resources to create sustainable businesses, is part of a rising trend in which African women are not only lifting themselves out of extreme poverty, but also creating thousands of well-needed jobs in their communities.  Village Enterprise-trained, Ugandan tailor Angela Adeke, who escaped extreme poverty in the wake of war-stricken Uganda epitomizes this growing trend. After receiving a small grant and graduating from Village Enterprises’ business training program, she became a successful tailor and now produces uniforms for 4,000 students.

					Women's Finance Network Microfinance Initiative Provides Opportunities for High School and College Interns
				</h3>

				<p>
					Robyn Nietert is helping improve the lives of East African women, one loan at a time.
					Nietert is president of the Women's Finance Network, a Cabin John-based nonprofit that offers small loans to women seeking to launch businesses in rural Uganda and Kenya.
					"There is no lack of financial institutions in east Africa," Nietert said. "They line the streets of every city. The problem is that they don’t lend to rural women. We want to bridge that gap.”
					Loans of up to $250 are distributed to women who use profits from agricultural and other businesses to buy more nutritious food, pay school fees, and upgrade their mud and dung houses. After two years, borrowers are eligible for bank loans, Nietert said.
					Before receiving loans, the average borrower’s income was 19 cents per day, according to an August 2011 report from the initiative on nearly 200 borrowers in Uganda. After receiving a loan, borrower income increased to $1.27 per day.
